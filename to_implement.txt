finish data handler

DO THIS FIRST:
CHECK numerical accuracy of LMO-K. There seem to be some problems
BENCHMARKING, BENCHMARKING, AND MORE BENCHMARKING!!!
!benchmark AO, MEMAO, LMO, MO HF for acid series
benchmark AO, MEMAO, LMO ADC(1) for acid series (balanced and non balanced)
do it for cc-pvdz and aug-cc-pvdz
try different clustering methods

reordering method for chol
use sparse operations for chol
use sparse matrix inverter

when reserving space for integrals, too much is reserved at once!!! Fix that!

OTHER
(Ortho)normalize matrix before doing SVD, CHOLESKY ETC...
save adc trial vectors to disk when not used
save other matrices in adc2 MVP if not used
libcint optimizer
new basis set clustering (group by exponent fitted to STO)
give SCALAPACK its own communicator (MPI duplicate)
memory estimator for each module
batched contrcation for tensors
